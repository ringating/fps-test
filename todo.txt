firing
    +kick/recoil
        simple snap back lerp forward
        perhaps just add a public function addToOffset(Vector3) that another script can call on each shot
    -screen shake
        spring motion with linear dampening
            positional: probably
            rotational: maybe (this would actually work really well if using Camera.unproject_position(Vector3) to determine crosshair location on screen)
    -sound
        yoink some sound from some game
        alternatively, use a sound from that big sound library you downloaded at some point
    -angle weapon in response to mouse movement
        mixing this with the positional sway may be good
        
        
-timer to cap framerate?

-restrict vertical mouselook?
    tbh who cares really, might play nicer even if it's nonstandard



dumb ideas
    make camera lerp to actual aim position (shown by crosshair moving independently of camera)
