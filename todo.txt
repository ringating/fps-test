need todo
    figure out how to use classes properly
        want to be able to make a gun class that contains all the necessary variables to have a unique gun
    movement
        collision
    recoil (non-placeholder)
    nice screen shake
    dynamic fov adjustment (for ads)
    sound

nice todo
    angle weapon in response to mouse movement
        mixing this with the positional sway may be good
    restrict vertical mouselook?
        tbh who cares really, might even play nicer despite being nonstandard
